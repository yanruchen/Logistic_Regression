# Logistic_Regression

Machine learning project using matlab

We are given a sample of 100 students. Given two exam scores and the admission result (0 for not admitted, 1 for admitted), we do the following:
1. Plot the exam scores and result on a graph, use "o" for not admitted, and "+" for admitted.
2. Compute cost and gradient for logistic regression.
3. Use fminunc function to find the optimal parameters theta.
4. Plot decision boundary.
5. Use the logistic regression model to predict the probability that a student with score 45 on exam 1 and score 85 on exam 2 will be admitted.
6. Compute the training and test set accuracies of our model.
